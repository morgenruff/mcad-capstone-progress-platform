                    A robust digital and physical presence for the Weavers Guild
                    of Minnesota, encapsulating web, print, and in-person

                <p class="description">
                    The Weavers Guild of Minnesota (WGM), a nonprofit
                    organization based in Minneapolis and founded in 1940 by
                    textile weaver and artist Hilma Berglund, occupies am unique
                    place within the art/craft landscape in the US. Offering
                    robust, year-round classes & workshops on many handmade
                    textile weaving, spinning, and dyeing methods, WGM is a
                    critical lifeline in the fight against industrial textile
                    processes and consumption patterns that play a large part in
                    advancing climate crisis.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    The problem: WGM has a currently lackluster web presence.
                    Designed and developed in the mid-2010s, the Wordpress-based
                    site serves its purpose of communicating basic information
                    about WGM, but doesn’t do much to inspire its audience,
                    rather focusing on utilitarian content. WGM needs to put its
                    best foot forward in its communications to continue playing
                    its vital role for another 85 years. I’m inspired by
                    like-minded organizations, e.g. the American Swedish
                    Institute, Penland School of Craft, and Wildcraft Studio
                    School.

                        <p>
                            I think my prototype is in an OK place at the
                            moment, it could be more fleshed out for sure, but I
                            have also been taking it somewhat easy the last week
                            due to some vague burnout feelings between work and
                            school. Just needed to re-orient a little bit. I’m
                            also waiting to hear back from the client on initial
                            work, but should have that conversation soon and be
                            able to move forward a bit more swiftly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the next two weeks (by Oct. 19), I plan to have a
                            Figma version of the site complete. This will be
                            page templates, so not every single page will be
                            designed, but rather reusable designs that can recur
                            across the site, approximately 10 in total. I also
                            plan to have user feedback shored up in the same
                            timeline. These two things will be working in tandem
                            with each other &mdash; feedback and revision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Following this intensive prototyping period, in week
                            9 (starting Oct. 20), I’ll begin site development in
                            earnest. There is one moving part to work out prior
                            to this: gaining full access to WGM’s web hosting in
                            order to being building in a staging environment.
                            This handled by a third-party development company (I
                            have a good working relationship with them, so not
                            worried, just need to go through it). I plan to
                            attend to that this coming week.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Otherwise I’m feeling good about the progress I’ve
                            made so far, but know I have quite a bit of work
                            ahead of me these next 4-5 weeks and into the final
                            stretch of the semester.

                                experience, and motion design (maybe). I think
                                I’m significantly stronger in all of these areas
                                than when I entered the program, and can
                                consider myself of at least a professional level
                                in all areas.

                                At this point, I could use to add quite a bit
                                more research to my capstone project, and will
                                plan to do so in the next few weeks. In
                                particular I’d like to add more sources dealing
                                with web accessibility, new functionality in
                                CSS, along with much more about the Wordpress
                                ecosystem in which I’m working. I think what I
                                have so far is good, but could definitely be
                                added to and made more complex & useful.

                                wireframes/prototypes. I also participate in
