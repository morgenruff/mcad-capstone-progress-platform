                A robust digital and physical presence for the Weavers Guild of
                Minnesota, encapsulating web, print, and in-person materials to

            <p class="description">
                The Weavers Guild of Minnesota (WGM), a nonprofit organization
                based in Minneapolis and founded in 1940 by textile weaver and
                artist Hilma Berglund, occupies a unique place within the
                art/craft landscape in the US. Offering robust, year-round
                classes & workshops on many handmade textile weaving, spinning,
                and dyeing methods, WGM is a critical lifeline in the fight
                against industrial textile processes and consumption patterns
                that play a large part in advancing climate crisis.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                The problem: WGM has a currently lackluster web presence.
                Designed and developed in the mid-2010s, the Wordpress-based
                site serves its purpose of communicating basic information about
                WGM, but doesn’t do much to inspire its audience, rather
                focusing on utilitarian content. WGM needs to put its best foot
                forward in its communications to continue playing its vital role
                for another 85 years. I’m inspired by like-minded organizations,
                e.g. the American Swedish Institute, Penland School of Craft,
                and Wildcraft Studio School.
