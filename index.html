                    A robust digital and physical presence for the Weavers Guild
                    of Minnesota, encapsulating web, print, and in-person

                    The Weavers Guild of Minnesota (WGM), a nonprofit
                    organization based in Minneapolis and founded in 1940 by
                    textile weaver and artist Hilma Berglund, occupies am unique
                    place within the art/craft landscape in the US. Offering
                    robust, year-round classes & workshops on many handmade
                    textile weaving, spinning, and dyeing methods, WGM is a
                    critical lifeline in the fight against industrial textile
                    processes and consumption patterns that play a large part in
                    advancing climate crisis.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    The problem: WGM has a currently lackluster web presence.
                    Designed and developed in the mid-2010s, the Wordpress-based
                    site serves its purpose of communicating basic information
                    about WGM, but doesn’t do much to inspire its audience,
                    rather focusing on utilitarian content. WGM needs to put its
                    best foot forward in its communications to continue playing
                    its vital role for another 85 years. I’m inspired by
                    like-minded organizations, e.g. the American Swedish
                    Institute, Penland School of Craft, and Wildcraft Studio
                    School.

                                Overall, I think I’ve demonstrated a strong
                                grasp and deep working knowledge of the tools
                                and technologies of web design through my
                                capstone project. By working with a real client
                                for the capstone project, not only am I showing
                                my skills developed through the program on a
                                design and technical level, but I’m also getting
                                that real-world experience that I can carry
                                through to my professional work in the field.

                                My capstone will deploy nearly all of the core
                                skills acquired in the MAGWD program: graphic
                                design, typography, color theory, web design,
                                web programming/development, interaction, user
                                experience, and motion design (maybe). I think
                                I’m significantly stronger in all of these areas
                                than when I entered the program, and can
                                consider myself of at least a professional level
                                in all areas.

                                    citation within the work itself, research
                                    assets will be accessible through an ongoing

                                At this point, I could use to add quite a bit
                                more research to my capstone project, and will
                                plan to do so in the next few weeks. In
                                particular I’d like to add more sources dealing
                                with web accessibility, new functionality in
                                CSS, along with much more about the Wordpress
                                ecosystem in which I’m working. I think what I
                                have so far is good, but could definitely be
                                added to and made more complex & useful.

                                illustrating progress, but also
                                wireframes/prototypes. I also participate in
